; Sample stunnel configuration file by Michal Trojnara 2002-2011
; Some options used here may not be adequate for your particular configuration
; Please read the manual and make sure you understand them

; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
; The default certificate is provided only for testing and should not
; be used in a production environment
cert = @prefix@/etc/stunnel/mail.pem
;key = @prefix@/etc/stunnel/mail.pem

; Security enhancements for UNIX systems - comment them out on Win32
; for chroot a copy of some devices and files is needed within the jail
chroot = @prefix@/var/lib/stunnel/
setuid = nobody
setgid = @DEFAULT_GROUP@
; PID is created inside the chroot jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

; Some performance tunings
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1

; Disable support for insecure SSLv2 protocol
options = NO_SSLv2

; Workaround for Eudora bug
;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; Authentication stuff needs to be configured to prevent MITM attacks
; It is not enabled by default!
;verify = 2
; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs
; It's often easier to use CAfile
;CAfile = @prefix@/etc/stunnel/certs.pem
; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls
; Alternatively CRLfile can be used
;CRLfile = @prefix@/etc/stunnel/crls.pem

; Debugging stuff (may useful for troubleshooting)
;debug = 7
;output = stunnel.log

; SSL client mode
;client = yes
